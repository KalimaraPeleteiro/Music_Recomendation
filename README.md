<h1 align="center"> Music Recomendation </h1>

Using a twenty thousand song spotify database, I clustered the songs in 50 groups, as shown in *clustering.ipynb*.
After that, a recommender was created using the clustered data, extracting info from the Spotify API in order to collect the musics' albums and
display them in matplotlib plotting image.

Nine songs, along aside the original song are recommended when using the recommender.
