<h1 align="center"> Music Recomendation </h1>

Using a twenty thousand song spotify database, I clustered the songs in 50 groups, as shown in *clustering.ipynb*.
After that, a recommender was created using the clustered data, extracting info from the Spotify API in order to collect the musics' albums and
display them in matplotlib plotting image.
<br></br>
Nine songs, along aside the original song are recommended when using the recommender.

<p align="center">Result for using the recommender with "Shape of You", from Ed Sheeran as a basis.</p>
